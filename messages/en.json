    "p1": "After teaching English in UAE classrooms for over 8 years, I saw a repeating challenge—bright, capable students struggling to understand English, not because they lacked potential, but because most learning tools weren’t made for them. I founded NoorLingo to change that.",

Our students needed more than recognition—they needed comprehension, connection, and context. NoorLingo was born to meet that need. We use culturally relevant stories, academic vocabulary, and reading strategies like predicting, visualizing, and summarizing—backed by research and designed for how children really learn.",
